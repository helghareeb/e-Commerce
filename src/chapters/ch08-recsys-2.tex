\chapter{Recommenders II: Deep Learning, Embeddings, and Retrieval (Week 8)}
\section{Scope (placeholder)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two-tower retrieval, embeddings, sequence models, and candidate generation vs re-ranking.
  \item Practical concerns: cold-start, diversity, bias, and latency.
\end{itemize}
\section{Hands-on lab (placeholder)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Train embeddings; build a retrieval + re-ranking pipeline (high level).
\end{itemize}
